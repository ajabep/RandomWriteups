Description
-----------

We found this fishy website for flashcards that we think may be sending
secrets. Could you take a look? 


Solution
--------

When we create a card with the question `{{2**2}}`, the question, in the list,
is printed as `4`. So we have a server-side template injection.

Following the identification from the first ressource (PortSwigger's blog post),
and of the second ressource (swisskyrepo's cheatsheet), we determine that the
template engine is Jinja2.

So it's time to begin to dump main values and start recon. First of all, we dump
the content of the variable `config` (with `{{ config }}`)â€¦ and obtain the flag.
