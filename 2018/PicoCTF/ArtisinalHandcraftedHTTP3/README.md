Description
-----------

We found a hidden flag server hiding behind a proxy, but the proxy has some...
_interesting_ ideas of what qualifies someone to make HTTP requests. Looks like
you'll have to do this one by hand. Try connecting via `nc
2018shell2.picoctf.com 46083`, and use the proxy to send HTTP requests to
`flag.local`. We've also recovered a username and a password for you to use on
the login page: `realbusinessuser`/`potoooooooo`. 


Solution
--------

When we are trying a TCP connection, with netcat, on the server, we have a
textual captcha. After fill this captcha, we have a TCP connection to an HTTP
reverse proxy. ![](whatisit.png)

The description gives us a host and credentials. We just have to connect to this
host and fill, with hands, the login form and win the flagâ€¦ oooor so, we may
have to waste time and automate the process to use a browser, a stupid choice I
made.

So, to have always a good answer to the captcha, I've based my script on the
first column of the char to decrypt it. I mean, to recognize the `2`, write with
as following:

```
 _____
/ __  \
`' / /'
  / /
./ /___
\_____/
```

my script parse only :

```
 
/
`
 
.
\
```

and apply a shifting for the next char. When the first line is the same for some
char, as the `+` and the `-`, my script will only read the second or the third
column:

```
 ______             _
|______|            _
   _       becomes 
 _| |               |
|_   _|
  |_|               |
```

Then, it listen a TCP port, the `8888`. To be able to browse to the target host,
we need to parametrize our browser to use the HTTP proxy `127.0.0.1:8888`.

Then, after filling the login form, we have the flag ! ![](flag.png)
